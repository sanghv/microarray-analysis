- Worked on Biplot stuff. 
- I need to get a working sample of the biplot in R working with our sample data. It'll be a great start. We can then dissect the implementation and whatnot.
- I need to polish up the proposal.
- I prolly should take down some of the docs and just start a Mendely. ----- LETS JUST USE SOURCE CONTROL
